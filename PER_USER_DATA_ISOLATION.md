# Per-User Data Isolation - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **What Was Fixed**

### **Problem**: Mixed Data Storage

- Authenticated users' data was still mixing with localStorage
- Global state wasn't properly isolated between users
- Data could leak between user sessions

### **Solution**: Strict Per-User Data Isolation

## üîí **Key Improvements**

### 1. **Authentication State Tracking**

```typescript
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState<any>(null);

// Track auth changes and clear data on sign-out
useEffect(() => {
  const { data: listener } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
    (event, session) => {
      setCurrentUser(session?.user ?? null);
      // Clear dayItems when user changes to prevent data leakage
      if (event === 'SIGNED_OUT') {
        setDayItems({});
      }
    }
  );
}, []);
```

### 2. **Conditional Data Loading**

- **Authenticated Users**: Load ONLY from Supabase per-user tables
- **Unauthenticated Users**: Load from localStorage as fallback

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentUser) {
    // Authenticated: don't load from localStorage
    return;
  }
  // Unauthenticated: load from localStorage
  const raw = localStorage.getItem('foodLog');
  if (raw) setDayItems(JSON.parse(raw));
}, [currentUser]);
```

### 3. **Conditional Data Saving**

- **Authenticated Users**: Save ONLY to Supabase (no localStorage)
- **Unauthenticated Users**: Save ONLY to localStorage

```typescript
// Save to localStorage only for unauthenticated users
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentUser) {
    return; // Authenticated: data saved to Supabase
  }
  localStorage.setItem('foodLog', JSON.stringify(dayItems));
}, [dayItems, currentUser]);

// DayEditor save logic
if (currentUser) {
  // Authenticated: save to Supabase only
  const created = await getOrCreateDayForUser(selectedDate);
  await persistDayItems(created.id, itemsForDay);
} else {
  // Unauthenticated: save to legacy API
  await fetch('/api/save-day', { ... });
}
```

### 4. **Data Cleanup on Import**

- When importing localStorage data to user account, clean up localStorage
- Prevents duplicate/conflicting data

```typescript
const handleImportLocal = async () => {
  // Import to user account
  await persistDayItems(created.id, importModal.localData);

  // Clean up localStorage after successful import
  const local = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('foodLog'));
  delete local[importModal.date];
  localStorage.setItem('foodLog', JSON.stringify(local));
};
```

### 5. **Visual User Status Indicator**

- Clear indicator showing where data is being saved
- Green badge: "‚úì Data saves to your account"
- Amber badge: "‚ö† Data saves locally only"

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Benefits**

### **Complete User Isolation**

- Each user can ONLY access their own data
- Database RLS (Row Level Security) enforces isolation
- No localStorage mixing between users

### **Session Management**

- Data cleared immediately on sign-out
- Auth state properly tracked throughout app
- Session persistence works correctly (previous fix)

### **Import Safety**

- Import modal shows exactly what's being imported
- LocalStorage cleaned after successful import
- User has full control over data migration

## üß™ **How to Test**

### **Scenario 1: User Data Isolation**

1. **Sign up** as User A, add foods to today
2. **Sign out**, **sign up** as User B, add different foods to today
3. **Sign out**, **sign back in** as User A
4. **Verify**: Only User A's foods are visible

### **Scenario 2: Storage Method Verification**

1. **Open Developer Tools** ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage
2. **While signed out**: Add foods, verify localStorage updates
3. **Sign in**: Add foods, verify localStorage doesn't change
4. **Sign out**: Verify localStorage is back to being used

### **Scenario 3: Import Process**

1. **While signed out**: Add foods to several dates
2. **Sign up/in**: Select a date with local data
3. **Import modal appears**: Choose "Import Local Data"
4. **Verify**: Data moved to account, localStorage cleaned for that date

## üéØ **Current State**

‚úÖ **Authenticated Users**:

- Data loads from Supabase user_days/user_day_items
- Data saves to Supabase only
- No localStorage interference
- Complete isolation between users

‚úÖ **Unauthenticated Users**:

- Data loads from localStorage
- Data saves to localStorage + legacy API
- Backward compatible with existing behavior

‚úÖ **Migration**:

- Smooth import process from localStorage to user account
- Clear UI indicating storage method
- Safe cleanup of old data

The app now provides **complete per-user data isolation** while maintaining backward compatibility for unauthenticated usage.
