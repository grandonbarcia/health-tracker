# Multi-User Food Tracker - Feature Summary

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. User Authentication

- **Sign Up/Sign In**: Users can create accounts and log in with email/password
- **Session Management**: Automatic session restoration on page reload
- **Sign Out**: Clean logout functionality
- **UI Integration**: AuthForm component in the header shows current user

### 2. Per-User Data Storage

- **Database Schema**: `user_days` and `user_day_items` tables with RLS (Row Level Security)
- **User Isolation**: Each user can only access their own data
- **Per-Day Tracking**: Users can track food consumption for different dates
- **Meal Organization**: Foods organized by breakfast, lunch, dinner

### 3. Data Management

- **Auto-Save**: Food entries automatically save to user's account when authenticated
- **Smart Loading**: App loads user's data when selecting dates
- **Fallback Support**: Works with localStorage when not authenticated
- **Data Import**: Smooth migration from localStorage to user account with confirmation modal

### 4. Search & Food Database

- **Centralized Database**: All foods stored in Supabase with search capabilities
- **Real-time Search**: As-you-type search with server-side results
- **Profile Caching**: Smart caching of food profiles for better performance
- **Nutrition Data**: Complete nutritional information for all foods

## ðŸ§ª How to Test the Multi-User Feature

### Prerequisites

- Dev server running: `npm run dev` (should be on http://localhost:3001)
- Supabase configured with the environment variables in `.env`

### Test Scenario 1: Create Account & Add Foods

1. **Visit http://localhost:3001**
2. **Create Account**:
   - Enter email/password in the form (top right)
   - Click "Sign up"
   - Note: Email confirmation might be required depending on Supabase settings
3. **Add Foods to a Day**:
   - Click on today's date in the calendar
   - Search for "mcnuggets" (we added this earlier)
   - Add it to breakfast/lunch/dinner
   - Click "Save" - data should persist to your account

### Test Scenario 2: Multi-User Isolation

1. **Sign out** (button in top right)
2. **Create a second account** with different email
3. **Add different foods** to the same date
4. **Sign out and back into first account**
5. **Verify**: You should only see the first user's data

### Test Scenario 3: LocalStorage Import

1. **Sign out** of all accounts
2. **Add foods while not signed in** (stores in localStorage)
3. **Sign up/in with a new account**
4. **Select the same date** you added foods to
5. **Import Modal should appear** asking if you want to import local data
6. **Test both options**: Import or Keep Account Data

### Test Scenario 4: Search & Add Foods

1. **While signed in**, try searching for:
   - "mcnuggets" (should find the McDonald's item we added)
   - "avocado" (from the original database)
   - Any partial food name
2. **Add items** and verify they appear in the calendar with item counts
3. **Check nutrition calculations** update properly

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Database Structure

```sql
user_days (id, user_id, day_date, metadata, created_at, updated_at)
user_day_items (id, day_id, food_id, qty, serving_override, metadata, created_at, updated_at)
foods (id, name, aliases, serving, calories, protein, carbs, fat, ...)
```

### Key Files

- `src/lib/user.ts` - User data management helpers
- `src/components/AuthForm.tsx` - Authentication UI
- `src/components/ImportModal.tsx` - LocalStorage import modal
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main app with integrated auth flows
- `sql/create-user-days.sql` - Database schema and RLS policies

### Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database enforces user isolation
- **Session-based Auth**: Supabase handles secure sessions
- **Service vs Anon Keys**: Proper separation of admin vs user access

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready for Use!

The multi-user food tracking feature is now fully functional. Users can:

- Create individual accounts
- Track their personal food consumption by date
- Search the centralized food database
- Have their data securely isolated from other users
- Import existing localStorage data when they first sign up

The system gracefully handles both authenticated and unauthenticated usage, making it backward compatible while adding powerful multi-user capabilities.
